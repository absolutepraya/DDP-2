# Foundations of Programming 2 (DDP 2)

This course focuses on the object-oriented programming paradigm using the Java programming language. Topics that will be studied in this course include: basic concepts of Java programming (variables, data types, and operators), branching (selection), repetition (loop), methods, object-oriented programming concepts (object, class, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract class & interface), exception handling, input/output operations, and development of desktop & web-based GUI (Graphical User Interface). Teaching and learning activities in this course aim to train students' skills in thinking systematically to find solutions to problems (computational thinking) and then use them in designing object-oriented programs by applying good programming practices. This course is taught through a combination of lectures and tutorials (practicum).
